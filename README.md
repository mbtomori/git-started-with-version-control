# `Git` Started with Version Control
This is an educational activity to introduce the concept of collaborating with others using version control tools
like `git` and GitHub.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- [ ] Explain how version control benefits software development.
- [ ] Describe what git is and how it works at a high level.
- [ ] Identify when you are using git and when you are using GitHub.
- [ ] Compare git to GitHub (and other version control tools).
- [ ] Select and use basic git commands that are common when working on a team.
- [ ] Use a git workflow to work in a group or on a team.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find:
- A git workflow to use when working independently (no branches).
- A git workflow to use when collaborating with a team (using branches).
    
The goal of this repository is to get you:
    1. More confident using simple git commands for development
    2. Provide practice using GitHub features like Pull Requests

## What to do to `Git` Started
I highly recommend using your terminal to navigate through this repository (once you have a copy of it, that is).
It's great for getting additional practice.

For now, simply navigate to [`1. What is Version Control`](git-activity/1-version-control.md) to `git` started. (Yes, I
really like the pun).

Using your command line, navigate to the `git-activity` directory. Inside, you should see files for the activities
mentioned above. 

#### Notes:
1. This tutorial doesn't cover installing git. If you do not have git installed, please find a tutorial to guide
you through it or use a virtual environment that has git installed.
2. These files are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), which will not be covered in this tutorial.
If you're interested, it's easy to learn and will help you when you create and format your own README.md files. You can 
use IntelliJ or other IDEs to view or edit Markdown files. If you use a basic text editor (like Sublime Text or vim), 
you will read the files with all the formatting.*
