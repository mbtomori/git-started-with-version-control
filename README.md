1. What is version control?
2. So what is `git`? and how does it compare to GitHub?
3. `git`ing started with your own fork
4. The `git` workflow for independent projects.
5. Collaboration using `git`
6. Best practices for collaboration
7. `git branch` and why you should use it
8. Requesting changes via GitHub Pull Requests
9. The dreaded MERGE CONFLICT

## What to do to `Git` Started
I highly recommend using your command line to navigate through this repository (once you have a copy of it, that is).
It's great for getting additional practice.

For now, simply navigate to [`1. What is Version Control`](NEED LINK) to `git` started.

Using your command line, navigate to the `git-activity` directory. Inside, you should see files for the activities
mentioned above. 

*NOTE: These files are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org), which will not be covered in this tutorial.
If you're interested, it's easy to learn and will help you when you create and format your own README.md files. You can 
use IntelliJ or other IDEs to view or edit Markdown files. If you use a basic text editor (like Sublime Text or vim), 
you will read the files with all the formatting.*
