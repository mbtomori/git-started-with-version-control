# Activity 9: Completion Log

## Learning Outcomes
- [ ] Use the collaboration workflow to create a pull request to the original, upstream repository.

## Overview
You are almost done! The last step of this activity is to create a pull request to the ORIGINAL repository (not your fork).

Remember the difference between cloning and forking? When you forked this repository, 
you made a copy of this repository in your personal GitHub account. Any pull requests you've submitted thus far
have been on that repository. But you can also make pull requests to the original repository, which is how you are
likely to contribute to open-source projects. This activity takes you through making a pull request to the original
repository,

Your goal in this activity is to add your name to the list below and make a pull request to the original, parent repository.



## Activity
Your goal in this activity is to add your name to the list below and make a pull request to the original, parent repository. 


- Use all the best practices you've learned thus far to create a branch, commit, and push your changes to your fork.
- Then use this resource on [Creating a Pull Request from a Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to create
a pull request to the original, upstream repository. The upstream repo to submit to is: `mbtomori/git-started-with-version-control`.
- If you do not want your name published, please add a note in the pull request (i.e. Don't merge!) 
  
This is one of the primary ways to contribute to open-source projects. 

## Request
This is an open source project in very early stages. As such, there will be typos, strange wording, and completely
confusing sections. I would greatly appreciate your contributions to the parent repository via pull requests. If you 
are willing and able to contribute, thank you! To aid in reviewing pull requests, please be sure to add a brief summary
of the changes you're making and why to the text box in the pull request. 

THANK YOU!!!
