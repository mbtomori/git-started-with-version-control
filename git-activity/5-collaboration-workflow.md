## Activity:
When you work on simple projects, you can most often do all of your work in the `main` branch. When you start working on 
more complicated projects, you may want to utilize branches. In that case, look at the [Collaboration]() Workflow which 
covers branches. 

For simple projects, the workflow most often includes committing, pushing, and pulling.

## Summary Git Workflow for Collaboration:
1. `git pull orign main //get most recent chages` 
2. make your changes
3. `git status //see what files have changed` 
4. `git add <filename> //ex. git add Notes.txt`
5. `git commit -m "Your awesome commit message`
6. `git push origin main //to push to GitHub`
