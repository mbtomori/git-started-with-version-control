# Activity 4: The `git` workflow for independent projects

## Learning Outcomes
- [ ] Explain what common `git` commands do
- [ ] Use an existing workflow to create a new file in your repository. 

**NOTE: At this point, you should be using your local copy of your forked repository to go through this tutorial 
so you can do the activities. You should not be reading this on the GitHub website.**

Now that you know how version control can benefit you in your development, let's go through a workflow to use
when you are working by yourself. This workflow will explain each of the commands. You can use it as a cheatsheet
when you are working on any project. 

## Activity:
When you work on simple projects, you can most often do all of your work in the `main` branch. When you start working on 
more complicated projects, you may want to utilize branches. In that case, look at the [Collaboration]() Workflow which 
covers branches. 

1. Create a new file in this repository. Call it Notes (use .md for markdown or .txt for text file). 
2. Add a line of text to your file and save it. 
3. In your command line, type `git status`.




## Git Workflow:

#### Common `Git` commands:
- [`git commit`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit)

#### Additional Resources
Atlassian, the company that owns BitBucket (a GitHub competitor) has great tutorials on git. I highly recommend them.
