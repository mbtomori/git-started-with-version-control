# Activity 1: What is version control?

Version control is a software specific process that tracks and manages changes to a code base. If you use Google Docs
or other similar projects, you can often go back in time to "restore" a previous version of your document. 

Regardless of whether you are working by yourself or in a group, sometimes you want to go back and see a previous 
version of your code. Using version control will enable you to go back to any previous commit. Without version control, 
you'll likely be stuck relying on "undo," which will only go back so far.

Atlassian, the company that owns BitBucket (a GitHub competitor) has great tutorials on git. I highly recommend them.
