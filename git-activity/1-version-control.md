# Activity 1: What is version control?

## Learning Outcomes
- [ ] Explain how version control benefits software development for individual and collaborative work

## Version Control Introduction
Version control is a software specific process that tracks and manages changes to a code base. If you use Google Docs
or other similar projects, you can often go back in time to "restore" a previous version of your document. 

Regardless of whether you are working by yourself or in a group, sometimes you want to go back and see a previous 
version of your code. Using version control will enable you to go back to any previous commit. Without version control, 
you'll likely be stuck relying on "undo," which will only go back so far.

When used in software development, version control is a practice rather than a tool. Teams may use version control 
software, like `git` to manage this practice. Atlassian has a great description of version control:
> Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
> Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 
> As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. 
> They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful 
> deployments....
> 
> Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. 
> If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix 
> the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.
> 
> Version control helps teams solve these kinds of problems, tracking every individual change by each contributor 
> and helping prevent concurrent work from conflicting. Changes made in one part of the software can be incompatible 
> with those made by another developer working at the same time. This problem should be discovered and solved in an 
> orderly manner without blocking the work of the rest of the team. Further, in all software development, any change 
> can introduce new bugs on its own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. So testing and development 
> proceed together until a new version is ready. (Excerpts from [What is Version Control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)).

`git` is a common version control software that many teams and companies use to manage their codebase(s). You'll learn
more about it in the next activity, but it isn't the only type of version control software that is used today. 

## Activity:
Based on the description of version control above, what are the benefits of using version control when working by yourself?
What are the benefits of working in a team? Feel free to write these down (and add them to this page in the next activity), 
or just think about it for yourself.

Atlassian, the company that owns BitBucket (a GitHub competitor) has great tutorials on git. I highly recommend them.
