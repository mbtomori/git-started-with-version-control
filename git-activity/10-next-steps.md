# Activity 10: Where do I go from here?

## Overview
This tutorial covered a lot of introductory topics, so I hope you've learned a lot! Like most things, there is still
a LOT to learn about version control tools like git and GitHub. So here are some additional resources you can use
to deepen your knowledge:

- Atlassian's [Learn Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud) tutorial, which covers
everything we've covered here (in more detail) as well as some advanced concepts
- [FreeCodeCamp: The Beginners Guide to Git and GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)
- [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- [Interactive Git Tutorial](https://github.com/chriskite/git-tutorial)

As with most things in software development, you will learn the most when you mess up and need to fix it. Search 
for answers whenever you encounter problems. 

## Get a Git CheatSheet
Download [Atlassian's Git Cheat Sheet](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/atlassian-git-cheatsheet) (or any other
cheat sheet) to help you when you are working with git.

## Ask for help!
If you are strugging and can't find an answer -- reach out to someone. There are a lot of folks who are great with 
git and can help you get unstuck. 

# Good luck on your Git Journey! Have fun!
